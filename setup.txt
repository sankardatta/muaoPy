install pip -> sudo apt-get install python-pip
install tornado -> sudo pip install tornado
install mysql server -> already installed
login with$ mysql -uroot -ppassword

install mysqldb python -> sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb

go to mysql and create a database
and execute > source /path/createTables.sql
modify user and password for mysql in Settings.py

to support Pablo's new code with separate generate_code and 
problem file, we need to install python pudb (pip(3) install pudb)
and also add the muaompc(the one inside muaompc with _init_) python to
pythonpath


Python 2.7 to Python 3.4 changes

Tasks:
1. MySql Database change:
   # Login into Mysql DB using the command 
     >> mysql -uroot -p
     ( you will find your password in the Settings file by the keywords passwd. I guess that empty for you in which case you just press enter. ) 
   
   # >> show databases;
      ( I believe there would be a database called muoPy; )
      
   # >> use muoPy;
   
   # >> Alter Table users Modify Password varchar(255);

2. Install mysql connector. Help can be found at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23376103/python-3-4-0-with-mysql-database/34558741#34558741
   
   #Download the package:
     $ wget "http://cdn.mysql.com/Downloads/Connector-Python/mysql-connector-python-2.0.4.zip#md5=3df394d89300db95163f17c843ef49df"
     In case you need, the link is "https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysql-connector-python/2.0.4"
   
   # unzip the zip/gz folder you downloaded. In case you used wget, it will be the zip file where u can use:
     $ unzip /path/to/downloads/folder/mysql-connector-python-VER.zip
   
   # Install using python3.4
     $ cd mysql-connector-python-VER
     $ python3 setup.py
